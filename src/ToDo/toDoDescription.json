    "toDoDescription": "This React application manages a list of todos with form validation. The main functionality includes displaying todos, allowing users to add, edit, and delete todos, and marking todos as completed. The app utilizes React state hooks such as useState to manage todo data and modal visibility. It consists of components like MyTodos, Modal, and CreateTaskForm, which handle different aspects of the todo management. The MyTodos component renders the list of todos, allowing users to interact with them. The Modal component handles the display of a modal for adding or editing todos. Finally, the CreateTaskForm component provides a form for adding or editing todos, with form validation ensuring that users input data into form fields before submissions or edits can proceed. This validation enhances user experience by prompting them to provide essential information, such as the title of the todo, before proceeding. The App component integrates these components and manages state and event handling for the todo functionality."
